# *Weather Database Challenge*


## Overview:

#### Developed an app called PlanMyTrip. The application allows users to plan their ideal travel destination. What sets this application apart from others is that it narrows the findings based on the user's preferred temperature range. Once the minimum and maximum temperatures are entered, the application finds hotels in cities around the world that are within that temperature range. This app can help people from getting too far into planning a trip only to find out it will be too hot or cold when they plan on traveling.

## Visuals:

#### 1. Questions users are prompted to answer.

## Summary:

#### This is a good start for the application. Moving forward, more filters should be added. For example, people should be able to narrow down their search based on country. It would also be helpful to add restaurants to the application to eliminate the need for another application. Overall the application works and brings something new to the table; however, there is room for improvement.
